Initialize User
===============

Introduction
------------
This script is only to be used when creating users on aws ec2 (Ubuntu) with an existing 
authorization key and assumes <Keypair.pem> is located in the ``.ssh`` local directory.

Before running ``inituser.sh`` on your local machine, be sure the script is made 
executable by typing in ``chmod +x inituser.sh``



Default port is 22.
